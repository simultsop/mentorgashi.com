In the past two decades, humanity has been focused on promoting rapid technological advancement, and we have embraced the idea that it's okay to "move fast and break things." This has allowed many apps and hardware products to fail and reach the surface, and we have been totally okay with it. 

We have seen many of the creators of these "fast things" facing justice and having to explain the consequences of their broken products and how they plan to fix them. Despite this, technological breakthroughs and enhancements have continued to be gifted to the public.

It may take a few more years for us to fully understand the psychological changes that we have undergone as a result of these tech enhancements and gifts. We must consider how we can stay intact as a hyper-connected society, as this will be the only way for us to create this reality in this timeline.

As I reflect on the need to slow down and fix things, I have made a drastic reduction in my content consumption. This began during the global slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the increased focus on mental health has reminded me of my own shortcomings.

I am also becoming more selective about the products that I choose to use long-term. While I still enjoy trying out new things, I will only continue to use them if they provide value to my life, considering a quarter of a year as the trial duration. This will be my standard for holding onto products moving forward.

Of course, moving slow and fixing things doesn't mean that we should be stagnant or completely avoid taking risks. There will always be times when we need to move quickly in order to take advantage of opportunities or respond to challenges. 

Slowing down also allows us to fully consider the ethical implications of the technologies we create. Instead of constantly pushing out new updates and features, we can focus on perfecting what we already have.

Technology should not be a hindrance or a barrier to our progress. Instead, it should be a tool that we use to take us to new places and unlock new opportunities.
By prioritizing simplicity, user experience, and responsibility, we can create technology that truly serves humanity and enhances our lives.
